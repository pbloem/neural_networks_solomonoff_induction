class BrainPhoqueUTM(UniversalTuringMachine):
  """BrainPhoque (slight variant of BrainFuck) universal turing machine.

  Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
  This machine only uses 7 program characters, described in the link above. The
  machine uses a tape memory, filled with integers within the range
  {first_data_int, ... last_data_int}, which can be incremented or
  decremented with the '+' and '-' instructions, with wrap-around when reaching
  the boundaries of the interval.
  Moving the reading head on the data tape is done with the '>' and
  '<' instructions. Loops are created using the '[' and ']' instructions.
  Unlike the paper version, ',' is incuded and writes a uniformly random symbol to
  the work tape.
  Finally, outputs are returned with the instruction '.'.
  See the reference above for more details.

  BrainPhoque (BP) differs slightly from BrainFuck (BF).

  Why it differs:
  Programs for normalized Solomonoff induction are assumed to be infinite.
  But suppose we want to sample a BF program and run it for T=100000 steps.
  We know that the program size cannot be more than T, so we could sample
  programs of length T, but that's very wasteful as most programs will have
  loops. We want a more agnostic way to sample arbitrary programs.

  How it differs:
  Consider the evaluation of a BF program, and imagine that the instructions
  are sampled as the program is being evaluated. Suppose we sample a '[', and
  the data value is 1, then we need to sample the first instruction of the '[]'
  block, evaluate it and so on. However, if the data value is 0, we need to jump
  to right after the corresponding ']'; but the block does not exist yet. Since
  the block may have arbitrary length once sampled. One idea is to leave a
  placeholder for the block and fill-in the block when the evaluator actually
  enters the block. But this requires inserting elements in the middle of an
  array, which is expensive. A similar idea is to build the program as a tree,
  but then jumping becomes more complicated and less efficient.
  Instead, in order to keep a single array that only needs to be extended at the
  end, we change the semantics of BF slightly — though this not change the
  evaluation of the program.
  The BrainPhoque (BP) UTM executes the same instructions as BF. The main
  difference with BF is that code is sometimes written at a different location.
  More precisely, consider a BF block: A[B]C, where A, B and C are sequences of
  instructions. We call B the _body_ of the block, and C the _continuation_ of
  the block. In BrainPhoque, when encountering a '[', the meaning is the same as
  for BF, but when encountering a '{' the meaning is reversed, and the sequence
  is written A{C]…B where … means that there may be other instructions
  in-between. The block body B is pushed at a later point in the program, and
  the jump table is updated accordingly.
  Since newly sampled instructions are written only at the end of the program,
  we can use a single (extensible) array to generate the BP program.
  An additional property is that every sampled instruction is immediately
  evaluated, avoiding waste.

  Note about the probabilities of the output strings generated by the
  programs (bear with me, this is a little subtle):
  One may think of using the prior weight of the generated program to
  obtain a lower bound on the output sequence generated by this program.
  However, this is pretty loose compared to the cumulative weight of all
  the programs that output the same sequence (and possibly more) --- which
  is the actual quantity we care about.
  Instead, every program on our machine is assumed to be infinite(!). The
  BrainFreak machine ensures that every program is valid.
  The prior of a given program is A^{-n} with n->oo for a program alphabet
  of size A.
  The program are not prefix-free, but the sum of the prior weights is still
  (exactly) 1.
  Let Q be the set of all programs, let w_q be the prior weight of a
  program q.
  Suppose we run program p for T steps and we obtain output s (≤ T).
  Let N be the number of different instructions of the program p that have
  been evaluated during the T steps (N ≤ T).
  Then the Solomonoff mixture probability for s is
  M(s) = sum_{q in Q:U(q)=s*} w_q  ≥  A^{-N}

  Note that 'utm.run_program' returns a shortened program of length at most N.
  Actually, a few additional simplifications are performed on the program
  (see `short_program` in the result dictionary of `run_program`) to further
  increase the lower bound on the Solomonoff probability of the sequence.

  BP can read BF programs *iff* the first time any '[' is encountered the
  data value is not 0, that is, the evaluator immediately enters the body —
  otherwise the '[' should be replaced with '{' and the blocks should be
  moved to the end of the program.
